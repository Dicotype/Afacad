1) The files


The first version of Afacad is a variable font with a weight axis + italics.
There are 2 .glyphs files:
- Afacad.glyphs
- Afacad-Italic.glyphs

And two fonts files in the fonts folder fonts/Afacad/variable
- Afacad[wght].ttf
- Afacad-Italic[wght].ttf


To build them, run 'gftools builder config.yaml'

______________________

The second version of Afacad is called Afacad Flux. It's basically the same masters, gathered in one file + a back slant master. This version was created to add a backslant version, since we couldn't add it to the previous version that already had an italic.

There are one .glyphs file:
- AfacadFlux.glyphs

And one font file in the fonts folder fonts/Afacad_Flux/variable
- AfacadFlux[slnt,wght].ttf


To build them, run 'gftools builder config_flux.yaml'

______________________

To build all the fonts, run 'sh build.sh'


2) Add modifications

It's very important that all the files are synchronised. If you add for instance a greek support that you draw in Afacad Flux, make sure to copy it in Afacad and Afacad-Italic. 

The upright masters and italic masters are the same in all the .glyphs files. The only difference is a new master called "Backslant" in Afacad Flux.
