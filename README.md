The ’Afacad typeface project’ commenced in 2017 as a personalised lettering endeavour for Slagskeppet, a Swedish housing tenant, who sought fresh house address numbering for their entrances. The letters and numerals were meticulously crafted to harmonise with the architectural proportions and materials employed by Architect Sture Elmén during the 1940s.

‘Afacad Flux’ adds an extra dimension in the form of a back-slanted version to commemorate, amongst other things, the typesetting of river names in historical cartography. Furthermore, the inclusion of supplementary weights and expanded language support contributes to a versatile typeface collection well-suited for industrial and commercial applications.

The alphabet, numerals and symbols were designed by Kristian Möller (KTKM, https://www.ktkm.se) and are part of the Dicotype Library (Dicotype, https://www.dicotype.com).
