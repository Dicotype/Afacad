# Facade

The ‘Facade typeface project’ started in 2017 as a custom lettering project for the Swedish housing tenant Slagskeppet, who wanted new house address plaques for their entrances. The alphabet and numerals were designed to conform to the architectural proportions and materials used by the Architect Sture Elmén in the 1940s. The bespoke letters are cut out of thick steel and powder lacquered for long-lasting durability.

I plan to accomplish a functional typeface family suitable for industrial and commercial usage by adding weights and extending the language support.

The alphabet, numerals and symbols were designed by Kristian Möller (KTKM, https://www.ktkm.se) and are part of the Dicotype Library (Dicotype, https://www.dicotype.com).

The Facade project is led by Kristian Möller, a type designer based in Stockholm. To contribute, see (https://github.com/Dicotype/Facade).
