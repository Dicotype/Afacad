# Facade
![Facade Blueprint](https://github.com/Dicotype/Facade/blob/main/documents/facade_02_blueprint.png)

The typeface <i>Facade</i> started as a custom lettering project for the Swedish housing tenant Slagskeppet, who wanted new house address plaques for their entrances. The letters were designed to conform to the architectural proportions used by the Architect Sture Elmén in the 1940s. They were later cut out of thick steel, and afterwards, powder lacquered for long-lasting durability.

By adding weights and extending the language support, I hope to accomplish a functional typeface family suitable for industrial and commercial usage.

The alphabet, numerals and symbols were designed by Kristian Möller (KTKM, https://www.ktkm.se) and are part of the Dicotype Foundry (Dicotype, https://www.dicotype.com).

The Facade project is led by Kristian Möller, a type designer based in Stockholm. To contribute, see (https://github.com/Dicotype/Facade).
