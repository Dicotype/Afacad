# Facade
![Facade Blueprint](https://github.com/Dicotype/Facade/blob/main/documents/facade_02_blueprint.png)

The typeface project <i>Facade</i> started in 2017 as a custom lettering project for the Swedish housing tenant Slagskeppet, who wanted new house address plaques for their entrances. The letters were designed to conform to the architectural proportions used by the Architect Sture Elmén in the 1940s. They were later cut out of thick steel and, afterwards, powder lacquered for long-lasting durability.

I plan to accomplish a functional typeface family suitable for industrial and commercial usage by adding weights and extending the language support.

The alphabet, numerals and symbols were designed by Kristian Möller (KTKM, https://www.ktkm.se) and are part of the Dicotype Foundry (Dicotype, https://www.dicotype.com).

The Facade project is led by Kristian Möller, a type designer based in Stockholm. To contribute, see (https://github.com/Dicotype/Facade).
